call shall attract interest from the day appointed for payment to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding 10% per annum (calculated daily by dividing 10% by 365 and charging that fraction for each day against the compounded or capitalised amount outstanding) as the Directors determine.  The Company may by special resolution passed in general meeting waive payment of interest

the share or by way of premium, shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the sum becomes payable, and, in case of non-payment, all the relevant provisions of this Constitution including imposition of a lien, payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture and sale apply as if the sum became payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</p><p data-block-key=\"6jbni\">10.7    The Directors may, in issuing shares, differentiate between shareholders as to the quantum of any calls on the shares and the time for payment of a call.</p><p data-block-key=\"aqaji\">10.8    The Directors may accept from a member the whole or part of any amount unpaid on a share although no part of that amount has been called up.</p><p data-block-key=\"3s1kd\">10.9    The Directors may authorise payment by the Company of interest upon the whole or any part of an amount so accepted, until the amount becomes payable, at such rate, not exceeding the prescribed rate, as is agreed upon between Directors and the member paying the sum.</p><p data-block-key=\"bifu5\">10.10  For the purposes of clause 10.9, the prescribed rate of interest is either,</p><p data-block-key=\"40b52\">(a)    If the Company has by resolution fixed a rate, the rate so fixed, or</p><p data-block-key=\"9qbrq\">(b)   In any other

transfer a share by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form that the Directors approve.</p><p data-block-key=\"b8g97\">11.2    An instrument of transfer referred to in clause 11.1 shall be executed by or on behalf of both the transferor and the transferee.</p><p data-block-key=\"am90l\">11.3    The transferor of a share under an instrument of transfer remains the registered holder of the share until the transfer is registered and the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect of the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"bjg8t\">11.4    The instrument of transfer must be left for registration at the registered office of the Company, together with such fee (if any) not exceeding the prescribed fee as the Directors require, accompanied by the certificate of the share to which it relates and such other information as the Directors properly require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, and, thereupon, the Company shall, subject to the powers vested in the Directors by the Constitution, register the transferee as a member.  The Directors shall have the power to waive the production of a share certificate provided they receive evidence satisfactory to them in their sole discretion that the certificate cannot be produced because of its loss or destruction.</p><p data-block-key=\"9ttgo\">11.5    The Directors may in their absolute discretion refuse to register any transfer of shares without assigning any reason for their refusal.  The Directors shall cause a notice of refusal of registration to be mailed to the transferor and the transferee within 60 days of such refusal. </p><p data-block-key=\"36vd3\">11.6    Any registration of transfer may be suspended at such times, and for such periods, as the Directors from time to time determine not exceeding in the whole 60 days in any year.</p><p data-block-key=\"h1ln\">11.7    It shall be the responsibility of the transferee to attend to all and any state or federal stamp duties, taxes or other costs levied or to be levied on the transfer of a share.</p><p data-block-key=\"fk66l\">12     TRANSMISSION OF SHARES</p><p data-block-key=\"1ehpu\">12.1    Where a member dies, a surviving member, where the deceased held the share as a joint tenant, or the legal personal representative of the deceased where the deceased held the share as the sole holder or as a tenant in common, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title or interest in the shareholding, but this clause does not release the estate of the deceased from any liability attaching to the share at the time of the member’s death.</p><p data-block-key=\"f0gfr\">12.2    Subject to the Bankruptcy Act 1966, a person becoming entitled to a share as the consequence of the death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such information being produced as is properly required by the Directors, elect either to be registered as a member or to nominate another person to be registered as a member. </p><p data-block-key=\"a641u\">12.3    Where a person becoming entitled elects to be registered as a member he or she shall give the Company written notice of the election. </p><p data-block-key=\"7pjpv\">12.4    Where a person nominates another person to be registered as a member, he or she shall execute a transfer of the share to that other person.</p><p data-block-key=\"cm27g\">12.5    All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of the Constitution relating to the transfer and the registration of transfer of shares are applicable to any such notice or transfer as if the death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy of the shareholder had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by the member.</p><p data-block-key=\"fb87m\">12.6    Where a member dies, suffers mental incapacity or becomes bankrupt, his or her personal representative or the trustee of his estate, as the case may be, is, upon the production of such information as is properly required by the Directors, entitled to the same dividends and distributions, and to the same rights (whether in relation to meetings of the Company, or to voting or otherwise), as the member would have been entitled to if he or she had not died, suffered mental incapacity or become bankrupt.</p><p data-block-key=\"c4uge\">12.7    Where two (2) or more persons are jointly entitled to any share as a consequence of the death or mental incapacity of a member, they shall, for the purpose of the Constitution, be deemed to be joint holders of the share.  For the purposes of this clause, where joint holders have a family or marital relationship, they shall be treated as joint tenants, otherwise they will be treated as tenants in common (in equal shares).</p><p data-block-key=\"p63g\">13     FORFEITURE OF SHARES</p><p data-block-key=\"dlp2l\">13.1    Where a member fails to pay either a call or an installment of a call on the day appointed for payment, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while any part of the call or installment remains unpaid, serve a notice of demand on the member requiring payment of so much of the call or installment as is unpaid, together with any interest and other costs of the Company accrued through the non-payment of the call.</p><p data-block-key=\"agold\">13.2    The notice of demand shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made and shall state that, in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the share in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.</p><p data-block-key=\"9qemp\">13.3    If the demands of a notice served under clauses 13.1 and 13.2 are not satisfied, any share in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment demanded by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors.</p><p data-block-key=\"c9oav\">13.4    Such a forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited share but not paid before the forfeiture.</p><p data-block-key=\"fbfut\">13.5    A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit, and, at any time before a sale or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit.</p><p data-block-key=\"503tk\">13.6    A person whose share has been forfeited ceases to be a member in respect of the forfeited share but remains liable to pay to the Company all money that, at the date of forfeiture, was payable to the Company in respect of the share (including interest at the rate of 10% per annum (calculated daily by dividing 10% by 365 and charging that fraction for each day against the amount outstanding) from the date of forfeiture on the money for the time being unpaid if the Directors think fit to enforce payment of the interest), but his liability ceases if and when the Company receives payment in full of all the money (including interest) so payable in respect of the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"441ig\">13.7    A statement in writing declaring that the person making the statement is a Director or a Secretary of the Company, and that a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date recorded in the statement, is prima facie evidence of the facts recorded in the statement as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"38la2\">13.8    The Company may receive the consideration (if any) given for a forfeited share on any sale of the share and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold.</p><p data-block-key=\"24qoi\">13.9    Upon the execution of the transfer, the transferee shall be registered as the holder of the share and is not bound to see to the application of any money paid as consideration.</p><p data-block-key=\"far0u\">13.10  The title of the transferee to the share shall not be affected by an irregularity or invalidity in connection with

be liable for any damage or injury caused by the guest as if the damage or injury had been caused by the member.</p><p data-block-key=\"e1obd\">30.6    The Directors may, under contract, grant to

dividends from time to time declared in respect of such shares. </p><p data-block-key=\"bng99\">30.11  Any member aggrieved by the Directors assessment of damage or loss, may apply to the Courts of New South Wales for a re-determination as to quantum or may agree with the directors upon an alternative form of arbitration or determination. </p><p data-block-key=\"b65id\">30.12  The terms and

Share transfers must only be transacted using the company’s share transfer form available on request from the Secretary. The company Secretary can assist buyers and sellers to make contact, and can provide guidance on completing the formal transfer documents.</p><p data-block-key=\"ap17r\">A share transfer will only be registered by the company if the buyer is a person. Shares cannot be registered by a trust, company, superannuation fund, or the name of an estate or deceased person. Prerequisites for share registration approval include, but are not limited to; receipt of a Share Transfer Form compliant with completion instructions; and approval of the buyer by the company’s Board of Directors as required by clause 11 of Neige Constitution.</p><p data-block-key=\"cqmhj\">A share transfer will require the buyer(s) to nominate one person to be considered the “Senior Member” and this person will be the only person registered on the Neige books as being the listed Senior Member.</p><p data-block-key=\"76ehu\">A share transfer is a private arrangement between the seller and buyer. As a service to sellers and prospective buyers, the Secretary maintains a list of people who have advised the company they are interested in purchasing a share.</p><p data-block-key=\"91cvd\">It is up to the buyer and seller to negotiate the share sale price. This does not involve the company, however, as a guide to the market price, the Secretary will on request, provide the seller and buyer the average price of the last three share sales and the most recent insurance valuation of the property.</p><p data-block-key=\"a8fi5\">The Company Constitution and Policies for use of company property are available on the Neige website. Sellers may provide these policies to prospective buyers to inform them of their privileges and obligations as a Neige shareholder.</p><p data-block-key=\"b4r1c\">It is strongly suggested the buyer seek written confirmation from the company Secretary as to the exact registered ownership details of the share number for sale and to confirm there are no outstanding moneys due to the Company relating to that Share.</p><p data-block-key=\"117oc\">The seller will confirm to the secretary if they are still in possession of a security door key. If not a fee of $170 for key replacement will be added to the sellers account, and the buyer notified of this debt. Each share is entitled to one door key only.</p><p data-block-key=\"ddvbs\">Once a price has been agreed between the seller and buyer, the seller should contact the Secretary to obtain a Share Transfer Form. The seller should then complete and sign their section of the form (notes are attached to the form to assist). All company registered owners of that share must sign the seller’s section of the form. [If the share is a deceased estate, contact the Secretary]. The seller then sends the form to the buyer with a copy to the Secretary who can assist with identifying any completion errors. The seller must also return their security key via registered post in a padded bag at their own expense to the Secretary at this time.</p><p data-block-key=\"evkvr\">No funds for the share purchase should be transferred by the buyer until the Secretary provides written approval that the share transfer has been approved by the company Board of Directors and the Share Transfer Form has been correctly executed [refer above note] by both seller and buyer.</p><p data-block-key=\"dsc6e\">The buyer (“Senior Member”) should then complete their section of the Share Transfer Form; ensuring only one buyer name and signature are used on the form. The form is then returned via Registered mail, to the Secretary.</p><p data-block-key=\"bht0p\">The Secretary will write to the buyer and provide, if appropriate, written approval that the share transfer has been approved by the company Board of Directors and that the Share Transfer Form has been correctly completed. The Secretary will then advise the buyer that share purchase funds may be transferred to the seller.</p><p data-block-key=\"d9u5m\">If the Board of Directors decline to approve the buyer (no reasons need be given); or the Share Transfer Form is not correctly completed, the Secretary will advise buyer and sellers and suggest the action which needs to be taken.</p><p data-block-key=\"6p3k2\">Following share sale approval in writing by the Secretary, the seller must advise the company Secretary in writing when the share purchase funds have been received. Once financial settlement has occurred the Secretary will change ownership registration of the share in the Company's share register and notify ASIC.</p><p data-block-key=\"f61n0\">The Secretary will advise the buyer in writing of completion of share transfer and registration; provide a door security key and other introductory information.</p><p data-block-key=\"dn2j6\">The company booking IT system manager and treasurer will set up an account on the company’s web-based booking system in the buyer’s name and email address and advise the buyer. The buyer can then book accommodation and commence use of the lodge.</p>"

Additionally, the number of rooms that may be rented per Member will vary between periods of the year.  This will be structured to ensure equity of access by all Members at times of different demand.  The Directors will review the application of this rule annually, and publish this on the Website.</p><p data-block-key=\"cg1bm\">The Premises is intended primarily for use by Members and their immediate families, and rents will be structured accordingly.</p><h2 data-block-key=\"38h6j\">Booking Processes</h2><p data-block-key=\"b4gur\">All bookings for use of the Premises will be made via the Company’s Website.  The Website can be accessed by only one username and password per share as advised by the Senior Member.

It will be the responsibility of the Senior Member to onpass this form to others where necessary. </p><h2 data-block-key=\"1r0j5\">Access &amp; Security</h2><p data-block-key=\"fhah8\">Access to the Premises will be controlled by key.  One key only will be issued to each Senior Member at no charge provided that the Senior Member remains financial.  Senior Members agree to be bound by these Rules as a condition of being issued a key.</p><p data-block-key=\"1ua53\">The Management Committee may, under direction from the Directors, change the locks to the Premises and issue new keys.</p><p data-block-key=\"8ferp\">Members will be responsible for the use and security of their key.  The replacement of lost keys will be charged at a cost as determined by the Directors and if no such cost is determined then the fee will be $170 per key.</p><p data-block-key=\"8hrtr\">The Management Committee may use external security devices (eg security cameras) to aid in property management and security.</p><h2 data-block-key=\"3s6nh\">Use of Facilities</h2><p data-block-key=\"a209\">The premises operates on a community-cooperative basis.

Cooking utensils and dishes are to be washed, dried and put away by those who used them in a timely way such that other residents can use them in the same period.  Stoves, ovens and bench tops are to be cleared and cleaned at the same time.  In particular, dishes are not to be left to soak in sinks or left to dry in racks such that other residents cannot have access to these facilities.</p><p data-block-key=\"bldpm\">Residents are not to use furniture for purposes other than for what it is intended.  In particular it is not acceptable to sleep on the sofas overnight or outside a bedroom.</p><p data-block-key=\"5a252\">Residents will occupy only the rooms that are allocated to them, and use only the numbered refrigerator, freezer and pantry spaces which are allocated to that room number.</p><p data-block-key=\"8pfev\">Residents will ensure that no more than 4 persons (including children) occupy a single room.</p><p data-block-key=\"1h1no\">Residents will use the clothes drying room in a responsible manner consistent with shared occupancy.

No vehicle is to be parked in such a way as to obstruct another vehicle or in an unallocated numbered car space.</p><p data-block-key=\"fs8de\">Kitchen refuse and recyclable materials (bottles, containers, paper etc) is to be removed from the kitchen area daily.  This material must not be allowed to accumulate in the kitchen or elsewhere inside the Premises.  Adequate RED garbage bins and YELLOW recycling bins are available.  Depending on volume, trips to the garbage tip should be regularly made, and responsible disposal of recyclable material is encouraged.  It will be the responsibility of all residents to share in the task of taking garbage to the tip.  There is a tip at Jindabyne and another in Berridale operated by the Snowy River Shire Council.</p><h2 data-block-key=\"bvs8t\">Personal Possessions</h2><p data-block-key=\"fhb36\">Residents are responsible for their personal possessions which should not be left in common areas.  The Company will not accept responsibility for missing possessions.</p><p data-block-key=\"acoef\">No personal bulky or dirty equipment (such as skis, ski boots, fishing equipment, bob sleds etc) are to be taken upstairs and must be stored in the downstairs workshop area.</p><p data-block-key=\"f2e6a\">No personal possessions are to be left at the Premises between bookings.

No residents are permitted to be on the Premises at these times to ensure the cleaner has unhindered access.</p><p data-block-key=\"15ghk\">The Directors will publish a duties list which outlines duties to be performed by the residents of each room during and at the conclusion of their period of residency. The duties list is posted on the back of each bedroom door. It is a condition of occupancy that all residents perform their fair share of assigned duties for the harmonious operation and cleanliness of the Premises.  Where duties are assigned for a room and that room is not occupied for that week then the residents of rooms 2 and 3 shall perform those assigned duties as necessary in exchange for the benefits that are attributed to those two rooms by popularity.</p><p data-block-key=\"7ppbg\">If a resident leaves early they will still be required to clean the room they used and a reasonable amount of common area under the roster or otherwise.</p><p data-block-key=\"1khhg\">Departing residents are to take all perishable food with them and not leave any such items in the refrigerators or freezers.  Non-perishable food may be left for others on the shelves allocated for this purpose and not in the refrigerators or freezers.</p><p data-block-key=\"j2mm\">During their stay residents are to leave the toilets and showers in a reasonably clean state after each use and not to leave in them any items of clothing, soap or toiletries for the duration of the occupancy.</p><p data-block-key=\"8gape\">Breaches of these Rules</p><p data-block-key=\"2gda2\">In the application of penalties or other action relating to breaches of these Rules, the Senior Member for whom the booking was made will be entirely responsible for the actions or omissions of any resident or residents who occupied the Premises under that booking, whether the Senior Member was in attendance or not.  It will be the entire responsibility of the Senior Member to therefore inform their guests of the Rules and their obligation to occupy the Premises in accordance with these Rules.</p><p data-block-key=\"32sss\">The Management Committee will, at its discretion, decide the severity of individual or accumulated breaches of these Rules.</p><p data-block-key=\"497p8\">For any loss breakage or damage to property caused by residents, the Senior Member will be required to remedy the situation to the satisfaction of the Management Committee.

In the application of this restriction, the Management Committee may, at its discretion, impose permanent or temporary bans on any guest of a Senior Member as regards their use of the Premises.  For repeated and persistent breaches of behaviour or other conditions, the Management Committee will refer the Senior Member to the Directors for action in accordance with Clause 30 of the Constitution which could result in forfeiture of the Senior Member’s share.</p><p data-block-key=\"9u7n4\">Payment of Levies</p><p data-block-key=\"l705\">In accordance with Clause 14 of the Constitution, an annual budget for the maintenance and improvement of the Premises will be presented by the Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Company and a levy on Members determined.

The Website can be<br/>accessed by only one username and password per share as advised by the Senior Member. The<br/>Website will be programmed to accept bookings in accordance with these rules, in particular with<br/>respect to seasonal occupancy rights and rental rates. The booking will be confirmed after payment<br/>has been made via the Website and after a Booking Acknowledgement form has been issued to the<br/>Senior Member by email. It will be the responsibility of the Senior Member to on pass this form to<br/>others where necessary.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"50dcg\">Booking Benefits and Restrictions</h3><p data-block-key=\"eo80j\">Members are able to use the lodge throughout the year, Different tariffs and room booking<br/>limitations apply during popular periods to ensure all members have an opportunity to use the<br/>lodge. During all bookings, a person meeting the “member in attendance” qualification must be<br/>present.</p><p data-block-key=\"74pi5\">Winter is defined as the months of July, August and September.  All other months are defined as<br/>summer. Winter rates are changed in December each year and Summer rates are changed in April<br/>each year.</p><p data-block-key=\"etnp6\">Bookings are normally made for one week, A Sunday-to-Sunday booking starts from the date of the<br/>first Sunday of occupancy, eg. a booking from the last Sunday in June which then runs into July<br/>would be deemed a summer booking. This will only apply during the first part week of winter.</p><p data-block-key=\"am73k\">In winter (excluding August), a member can book no more than 3 room-weeks in the same week. It<br/>will be best to book 2 rooms through website and 3rd through booking officer (our website is not<br/>currently capable of handling a 3 room booking).</p><p data-block-key=\"4spc\">In winter (August only), a member can book no more than 2 room-weeks in the entire month.  The 2<br/>room-weeks can be booked either concurrently or separately.</p><p data-block-key=\"4fqon\">In Winter, rooms 1,8 and 9 are available for full week or part week (including weekends) bookings.<br/>All other rooms are only available for full week bookings.</p><p data-block-key=\"cdaf8\">In Summer, members can book any number of rooms up to and including a “whole of lodge”<br/>booking. Our web site doesn’t currently cater for this whole lodge booking and requires a manual<br/>entry and invoice. Please contact our booking officer to book complete a whole of lodge booking for<br/>a summer week.</p><p data-block-key=\"4qbt2\">A member can make bookings no more than 26 weeks in advance of the first day of intended<br/>occupancy. </p><h3 data-block-key=\"6pj41\">Last Minute bookings</h3><p data-block-key=\"a3vif\">The Directors have decided to introduce a “last minute” booking option, which will only apply 2<br/>weeks before the required date for the available room. </p><p data-block-key=\"2em75\">Applicable only in winter (July to September inclusive), this will allow a Senior Member to make a<br/>booking for any available room without the normal limitations on number of room-weeks booked in<br/>each month.  </p><p data-block-key=\"3kvj\">The limitations on weekend bookings in only rooms 1,8 and 9 will still apply.</p><p data-block-key=\"4q4lv\">Making this last-minute booking will require the Senior Member to contact the Booking Officer (Noel<br/>Oxley) to make the booking and arrange payment.</p><p data-block-key=\"ftp3c\">For example, if a Senior Member already has 3 room-weeks booked in September, they would<br/>normally not be allowed to book any more room-weeks concurrently in that month.  If, however,<br/>there is a room still available 2 weeks out from when they wish to attend, they can apply to book<br/>that room by contacting Noel.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"osbm\">Cancellation of Booking</h3><p data-block-key=\"ahhf8\">Should a Senior Member need to cancel a booking a full refund of rents paid will be made if a<br/>written request is received 4 weeks prior to the first day of occupancy. If a request is received<br/>between 2 &amp;amp; 4 weeks prior to the day of occupancy a refund of 20% will be made. If less than 2<br/>weeks no refund will be made. At the discretion of the Booking Officer, refunds will only be paid to<br/>the Senior Member and this will be by transfer to a bank account, the details of which will be<br/>provided by the Senior Member. The amount refunded may be net of any fees or charges imposed<br/>by 3rd parties.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"5mvne\">Booking Conflicts</h3><p data-block-key=\"179li\">In instances where, through mis-programming or inadequacy of the Website, a booking is made<br/>which is at odds with these Rules the Booking Officer may, at his discretion and in consultation with<br/>the Senior Member, reject or amend the booking such that the conditions of these Rules will apply.</p>"

Shareholders are jointly responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the common areas and their individual bedrooms during their stay.</p><p data-block-key=\"io3e\">During winter and other heavily booked times a contract cleaner is engaged on Sundays to clean the entire lodge. The rates that are charged for residential occupancy recognise this operating model</p><p data-block-key=\"8mvmi\">The lodge provides beds &amp; mattresses, bathrooms and a fully equipped kitchen.  Guests provide their own bedding, toiletries and food.  There are rules pinned to the back of each bedroom door covering the requirement for guests to keep the lodge in a clean and tidy state during occupancy.  These rules also require residents to remove all personal belongings before checking out.  Importantly, on check-out, bathrooms, toilets, the kitchen and bedrooms used, must be in a clean and tidy state with all garbage disposed of.</p><p data-block-key=\"32lcu\">The management committee will periodically arrange more thorough cleaning by contractors.  Contract cleaning is relatively expensive and is provided for in the lodge operating model under the following conditions:</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"7ctvg\">   On Sundays (change-over day) in the months of June, July, August and September when very high occupancy of the lodge occurs;</li><li data-block-key=\"b1mnj\">   After occupancy by a single booker of the entire lodge at any time of the year;</li><li data-block-key=\"5bejt\">   On occasions when the management committee believes that occupancy has been at a sufficiently high level as to warrant thorough cleaning, and a financial justification for this applies.</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"dhm1g\">The use of contract cleaners outside the winter season will be the exception - not the rule.  It does not relieve the guests of the need to be responsible for their own cleaning.  It’s important that guests understand that, at all times, the self-catering nature of lodge operations requires them to clean the areas they used before checking out.  Even when contract cleaners are used, guests are not relieved of cleaning duties.</p><p data-block-key=\"benei\">Should residents be unable or unwilling to clean in situations outside those in 1 to 3 above, contract cleaning will be arranged by the management committee and the cost will be passed on to the resident.</p><p data-block-key=\"89mfl\">Should residents check out without cleaning in situations outside those in 1 to 3 above, action as covered for breeches of the Rules of Use of Company Property will apply.</p>"

higher rate of dividend or distribution, or where such resolution was opposed by the holders of a class of share who will receive a lower rate of dividend or distribution or who will be excluded from receiving a dividend or distribution.</p><p data-block-key=\"ktnc\">6.5      Should the Company be wound up or have its capital reduced, each class of share shall rank in the following descending order of priority as regards return of capital of the Company: Ordinary, \"A\", and \"B\".

redeem such of the \"B\" class redeemable preference shares as it may from time to time determine.</p><p data-block-key=\"a9s3l\">6.7      The Directors, subject to any resolution, may issue shares in the Company and attach to them preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, whether with regard to dividend, voting, return of capital, use of Company property or otherwise, provided that the Directors shall not prejudice special rights previously attached to a share or class of share unless specifically authorized to do so by resolution.</p><p data-block-key=\"4cpb4\">6.8      The Directors may vary the rights attached to any class of share unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares in that class and whether or not the Company is being wound up, if the Directors have the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters of the issued shares of that class, or have the authority of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.  The provisions of this Constitution relating to general meetings apply so far as they are capable of application to every such separate meeting except that a quorum is

class in itself.</p><p data-block-key=\"7o1na\">6.10    Holding an Ordinary share is a necessary prerequisite to the holding of a share of any other class.  A purported sale or transfer of a share in such other class of share to a person who does not hold an Ordinary share will not be recognized by the Company.  Where the holder of an Ordinary share purports to sell or transfer an Ordinary share while retaining ownership of a share in another class he or she shall forfeit the other share to the Company and the provisions of clause 13 shall apply to the forfeited share.</p><p

Company has been notified of any interest or right, and whether it be for an equitable, contingent, future or partial interest, in any share or part thereof or any other right in respect of a share, except an absolute beneficial right of ownership in the registered holder as provided by this Constitution or by law, </p><p data-block-key=\"55g8f\">8.3      A person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members is entitled without payment to receive a certificate of registration signed in accordance with Clause 19.3.  In respect of a share or shares held jointly or

not.   The lien shall include any dividends or distributions declared in respect of a share.</p><p data-block-key=\"b9pib\">9.2      The Company has a first and paramount lien binding on a member and the member’s estate with respect to a share, whether or not the share is a fully paid share, which has attracted a debt by law or pursuant to clauses 13 or 30 of the Constitution. </p><p data-block-key=\"cafci\">9.3      The Directors may at any time exempt a share wholly or in part from the provisions of this clause 9.</p><p data-block-key=\"874i6\">9.4      The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, a share on which the Company has a lien, provided that: </p><p data-block-key=\"cuadf\">(a)    Moneys in respect of the share are presently payable; and</p><p data-block-key=\"87sb4\">(b)   The Company has, not less than 14 days before the date of the sale, given to the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person entitled to the share by reason of the death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy of the registered holder, a written demand for the moneys payable.</p><p data-block-key=\"1en0j\">9.5      For the purpose of effecting a sale under clause 9.3, the Directors may authorise a person to transfer a share to a purchaser.   The Company shall (subject to clause 11.5) register the purchaser as the holder of the share without the purchaser being bound to see to the application of the purchase money by the Company.</p><p data-block-key=\"u2ne\">9.6      The title of a purchaser to a share shall not be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in connection with the sale or transfer.</p><p data-block-key=\"5gdp7\">9.7      The Company shall apply the proceeds of a sale effected under clause 9 in payment of any

of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium) and not, by the terms of issue of the share, made payable at fixed times, and a member shall pay the amount called on his or her share to the Company at the time specified by the Directors.  Any call may be revoked or postponed by the Directors.</p><p data-block-key=\"et6fp\">10.2    A member shall be entitled to receive at least 14 days notice of the time and amount of a call.</p><p data-block-key=\"vbu\">10.3    A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed and such resolution may require a call to be paid by installments.</p><p data-block-key=\"1qtql\">10.4    Joint holders of a share, whether they hold their interest in the share as joint tenants or as tenants in common are jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"6ni0i\">10.5    If a call is not paid before or on the day appointed, the unpaid call shall attract interest from the day appointed for payment to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding 10% per annum (calculated daily by dividing 10% by 365 and charging that fraction for each day against the compounded or capitalised amount outstanding) as the Directors determine.  The Company may by special resolution passed in general meeting waive payment of interest wholly or in part.</p><p data-block-key=\"6nfca\">10.6    Any sum that, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable on allotment or at a fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the sum becomes payable, and, in case of non-payment, all the relevant provisions of this Constitution including imposition of a lien, payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture and sale apply as if the sum became payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</p><p data-block-key=\"6jbni\">10.7    The Directors may, in issuing shares, differentiate between shareholders as to the quantum of any calls on the shares and the time for payment of a call.</p><p data-block-key=\"aqaji\">10.8    The Directors may accept from a member the whole or part of any amount unpaid on a share although no part of that amount has been called up.</p><p data-block-key=\"3s1kd\">10.9    The Directors may authorise payment by the Company of interest upon the whole or any part of an amount so accepted, until the amount becomes payable, at such rate, not exceeding the prescribed rate, as is agreed upon between Directors and the member paying the sum.</p><p data-block-key=\"bifu5\">10.10  For the purposes of clause 10.9, the prescribed rate of interest is either,</p><p data-block-key=\"40b52\">(a)    If the Company has by resolution fixed a rate, the rate so fixed, or</p><p data-block-key=\"9qbrq\">(b)   In any other case, as provided in clause 10.5 of the Constitution.</p><p data-block-key=\"egj7o\">11     TRANSFER OF SHARES</p><p data-block-key=\"8rbud\">11.1    Subject to this Constitution, a member may transfer a share by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form that the Directors approve.</p><p data-block-key=\"b8g97\">11.2    An instrument of transfer referred to in clause 11.1 shall be executed by or on behalf of both the transferor and the transferee.</p><p data-block-key=\"am90l\">11.3    The transferor of a share under an instrument of transfer remains the registered holder of the share until the transfer is registered and the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect of the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"bjg8t\">11.4    The instrument of transfer must be left for registration at the registered office of the Company, together with such fee (if any) not exceeding the prescribed fee as the Directors require, accompanied by the certificate of the share to which it relates and such other information as the Directors properly require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, and, thereupon, the Company shall, subject to the powers vested in the Directors by the Constitution, register the transferee as a member.  The Directors shall have the power to waive the production of a share certificate provided they receive evidence satisfactory to them in their sole discretion that the certificate cannot be produced because of its loss or destruction.</p><p data-block-key=\"9ttgo\">11.5    The Directors may in their absolute discretion refuse to register any transfer of shares without assigning any reason for their refusal.  The Directors shall cause a notice of refusal of registration to be mailed to the transferor and the transferee within 60 days of such refusal. </p><p data-block-key=\"36vd3\">11.6    Any registration of transfer may be suspended at such times, and for such periods, as the Directors from time to time determine not exceeding in the whole 60 days in any year.</p><p data-block-key=\"h1ln\">11.7    It shall be the responsibility of the transferee to attend to all and any state or federal stamp duties, taxes or other costs levied or to be levied on the transfer of a share.</p><p data-block-key=\"fk66l\">12     TRANSMISSION OF SHARES</p><p data-block-key=\"1ehpu\">12.1    Where a member dies, a surviving member, where the deceased held the share as a joint tenant, or the legal personal representative of the deceased where the deceased held the share as the sole holder or as a tenant in common, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title or interest in the shareholding, but this clause does not release the estate of the deceased from any liability attaching to the share at the time of the member’s death.</p><p data-block-key=\"f0gfr\">12.2    Subject to the Bankruptcy Act 1966, a person becoming entitled to a share as the consequence of the death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such information being produced as is properly required by the Directors, elect either to be registered as a member or to nominate another person to be registered as a member. </p><p data-block-key=\"a641u\">12.3    Where a person becoming entitled elects to be registered as a member he or she shall give the Company written notice of the election. </p><p data-block-key=\"7pjpv\">12.4    Where a person nominates another person to be registered as a member, he or she shall execute a transfer of the share to that other person.</p><p data-block-key=\"cm27g\">12.5    All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of the Constitution relating to the transfer and the registration of transfer of shares are applicable to any such notice or transfer as if the death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy of the shareholder had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by the member.</p><p data-block-key=\"fb87m\">12.6    Where a member dies, suffers mental incapacity or becomes bankrupt, his or her personal representative or the trustee of his estate, as the case may be, is, upon the production of such information as is properly required by the Directors, entitled to the same dividends and distributions, and to the same rights (whether in relation to meetings of the Company, or to voting or otherwise), as the member would have been entitled to if he or she had not died, suffered mental incapacity or become bankrupt.</p><p data-block-key=\"c4uge\">12.7    Where two (2) or more persons are jointly entitled to any share as a consequence of the death or mental incapacity of a member, they shall, for the purpose of the Constitution, be deemed to be joint holders of the share.  For the purposes of this clause, where joint holders have a family or marital relationship, they shall be treated as joint tenants, otherwise they will be treated as tenants in common (in equal shares).</p><p data-block-key=\"p63g\">13     FORFEITURE OF SHARES</p><p data-block-key=\"dlp2l\">13.1    Where a member fails to pay either a call or an installment of a call on the day appointed for payment, the Directors may, at any time thereafter while any part of the call or installment remains unpaid, serve a notice of demand on the member requiring payment of so much of the call or installment as is unpaid, together with any interest and other costs of the Company accrued through the non-payment of the call.</p><p data-block-key=\"agold\">13.2    The notice of demand shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made and shall state that, in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the share in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.</p><p data-block-key=\"9qemp\">13.3    If the demands of a notice served under clauses 13.1 and 13.2 are not satisfied, any share in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment demanded by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors.</p><p data-block-key=\"c9oav\">13.4    Such a forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in respect of the forfeited share but not paid before the forfeiture.</p><p data-block-key=\"fbfut\">13.5    A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit, and, at any time before a sale or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit.</p><p data-block-key=\"503tk\">13.6    A person whose share has been forfeited ceases to be a member in respect of the forfeited share but remains liable to pay to the Company all money that, at the date of forfeiture, was payable to the Company in respect of the share (including interest at the rate of 10% per annum (calculated daily by dividing 10% by 365 and charging that fraction for each day against the amount outstanding) from the date of forfeiture on the money for the time being unpaid if the Directors think fit to enforce payment of the interest), but his liability ceases if and when the Company receives payment in full of all the money (including interest) so payable in respect of the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"441ig\">13.7    A statement in writing declaring that the person making the statement is a Director or a Secretary of the Company, and that a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date recorded in the statement, is prima facie evidence of the facts recorded in the statement as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"38la2\">13.8    The Company may receive the consideration (if any) given for a forfeited share on any sale of the share and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold.</p><p data-block-key=\"24qoi\">13.9    Upon the execution of the transfer, the transferee shall be registered as the holder of the share and is not bound to see to the application of any money paid as consideration.</p><p data-block-key=\"far0u\">13.10  The title of the transferee to the share shall not be affected by an irregularity or invalidity in connection with the forfeiture, sale or transfer of the share.</p><p data-block-key=\"bqbqf\">13.11  The provisions of this Constitution as to forfeiture apply in the case of non-payment of any sum that by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if that sum had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</p><p data-block-key=\"bn91u\">14.    MEMBER CONTRIBUTIONS AND LEVIES</p><p data-block-key=\"7e36j\">14.1    The Company shall in each year or more often as it shall determine impose a levy on members for an amount not exceeding the sum of the reasonable expenses, charges and outgoings referred to hereafter in this clause 14.</p><p data-block-key=\"2oq9a\">14.2    The Directors shall, at least annually, prepare estimates of the expenses, charges and outgoings they expect to incur over the period covered by the estimates.</p><p data-block-key=\"dkfjj\">14.3    The Company shall, at each annual general meeting, determine, subject to clause 14.4, an estimate of the amount of money it will need to credit to the Company accounts for actual and expected expenditure, including but not limited to the following categories:</p><p data-block-key=\"agp06\">(a)    maintaining in good order and repair the Company's real and personal property. </p><p data-block-key=\"1ldag\">(b)

meet other recurrent expenses incurred in maintaining and protecting the Company’s property and assets.</p><p data-block-key=\"9dq9i\">14.4    When determining an estimate of the amount to be credited to the Company’s accounts pursuant to clause 14.3, the Company shall consider, among other things, a statement of the existing financial situation of the Company, an estimate of receipts and payments,

levied on each share as a contribution the amounts estimated as needing to be credited to the Company’s accounts.  That determination must be made at the same meeting at which those estimated amounts are determined.  </p><p data-block-key=\"78u3m\">14.6    The Company shall levy the contributions determined under Clause 14.5 by serving on the Senior member a written notice of the contribution

of the contribution.</p><p data-block-key=\"ce9f5\">14.8    If the Company, in any year, is subsequently faced with additional expenditure of a kind established under clause 14.3, that it cannot at once meet from the Company accounts, it shall, in order to meet the expenditure, levy on each member such contribution to the accounts as it determines at a general meeting of the Company.</p><p data-block-key=\"4r7m9\">14.9    Contributions levied by the Company shall be levied in equal proportions on each Ordinary share held.</p><p data-block-key=\"3c3n3\">14.10  If, at the time a person becomes a member, whether by transfer or transmission, the former shareholder is liable in respect of the share to pay a contribution levied on the share, the current shareholder is jointly and severally liable with the former shareholder for the payment of the contribution and for an interest incurred on the contribution.</p><p data-block-key=\"qga2\">14.11  Regular periodic contributions to the Company’s accounts are taken to have been duly levied on a member even though a notice or notices levying the contributions was or were not served on the member.</p><p data-block-key=\"1qtot\">14.12  Any contribution levied by the Company becomes due and payable to the Company in accordance with the decision of the Company to make the levy.  A contribution, if not paid at the end of one month after it becomes due and payable, bears until paid interest at an annual rate of 10 per cent or, if the Company determines another rate, that other rate.   However, the Company may by special resolution determine (either generally or in a particular case) that a contribution is to bear no interest.</p><p data-block-key=\"2divi\">14.13  The Company may, by special resolution, determine (either generally or in a particular case) that a person may pay 10 per cent less of a contribution levied if the person pays the contribution before the date on which it becomes due and payable.</p><p data-block-key=\"51ohl\">14.14  The Company may recover as a debt a contribution not paid at the end of one month after it becomes due and payable, together with any interest payable and the expenses of the Company incurred in recovering those amounts by action in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p data-block-key=\"77k0h\">14.15  The Directors may invest any money in the Company’s accounts in any manner permitted by law.</p><p data-block-key=\"c72n0\">15.    ALTERATION OF CAPITAL</p><p data-block-key=\"6a1or\">15.1    The Company may by resolution -</p><p

shares of lesser value than is fixed by the Constitution but so that in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount (if any) unpaid on each such share of a lesser value is the same as it was before the subdivision.</p><p data-block-key=\"9hg0g\">(d)   Cancel shares that, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person or have been forfeited and reduce its authorised share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.</p><p data-block-key=\"225g5\">15.2    Subject to any direction that may be given by the Company in general meeting, unissued shares shall first be offered to shareholders who at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the Company of general meetings and the number of

of the Company’s issued shares. </p><p data-block-key=\"7dpc1\">15.3    The offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered and a date and time at which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to have been declined.</p><p data-block-key=\"4834o\">15.4    Directors may issue in any manner they think beneficial to the Company any shares declined or deemed to have been declined.</p><p data-block-key=\"fm81t\">15.5    Where, by reason of the proportion that shares proposed to be issued bear to shares already held, some available shares cannot be offered in accordance with clause 15.2, the Directors may issue the shares that cannot be so offered in such manner as they think beneficial to the Company.</p><p data-block-key=\"bdkch\">15.6    The Company may, by

reasonable to cover the costs and expenses of complying with any notice served prior to the date of transfer of shares or such proportionate part of the said costs and expenses so incurred as aforesaid as would have been charged against the member had he or she continued to be a member, the balance shall be payable to the former member within one month after the date of registration of the transfer.</p>",

Prerequisites for share registration approval include,  but are not limited to; receipt of a Share Transfer Form compliant with  completion instructions; and approval of the buyer by the company’s  Board of Directors as required by clause 11 of Neige Constitution.</p><p data-block-key=\"cqmhj\">A  share transfer will require the buyer(s) to nominate one person to be  considered the “Senior Member” and this person will be the only person  registered on the Neige books as being the listed Senior Member.</p><p data-block-key=\"76ehu\">A  share transfer is a private arrangement between the seller and buyer.  As a service to sellers and prospective buyers, the Secretary maintains a  list of people who have advised the company they are interested in  purchasing a share.</p><p data-block-key=\"91cvd\">It is up to the buyer and seller to negotiate  the share sale price. This does not involve the company, however, as a  guide to the market price, the Secretary will on request, provide the  seller and buyer the average price of the last three share sales and the  most recent insurance valuation of the property.</p><p data-block-key=\"a8fi5\">The Company  Constitution and Policies for use of company property are available on  the Neige website. Sellers may provide these policies to prospective  buyers to inform them of their privileges and obligations as a Neige  shareholder.</p><p data-block-key=\"b4r1c\">It is strongly suggested the buyer seek written  confirmation from the company Secretary as to the exact registered  ownership details of the share number for sale and to confirm there are  no outstanding moneys due to the Company relating to that Share.</p><p data-block-key=\"117oc\">The  seller will confirm to the secretary if they are still in possession of  a security door key. If not a fee of $170 for key replacement will be  added to the sellers account, and the buyer notified of this debt. Each  share is entitled to one door key only.</p><p data-block-key=\"ddvbs\">Once a price has been  agreed between the seller and buyer, the seller should contact the  Secretary to obtain a Share Transfer Form. The seller should then  complete and sign their section of the form (notes are attached to the  form to assist). All company registered owners of that share must sign  the seller’s section of the form. [If the share is a deceased estate,  contact the Secretary]. The seller then sends the form to the buyer with  a copy to the Secretary who can assist with identifying any completion  errors. The seller must also return their security key via registered  post in a padded bag at their own expense to the Secretary at this time.</p><p data-block-key=\"evkvr\">No  funds for the share purchase should be transferred by the buyer until  the Secretary provides written approval that the share transfer has been  approved by the company Board of Directors and the Share Transfer Form  has been correctly executed [refer above note] by both seller and buyer.</p><p data-block-key=\"dsc6e\">The  buyer (“Senior Member”) should then complete their section of the Share  Transfer Form; ensuring only one buyer name and signature are used on  the form. The form is then returned via Registered mail, to the  Secretary.</p><p data-block-key=\"bht0p\">The Secretary will write to the buyer and provide, if  appropriate, written approval that the share transfer has been approved  by the company Board of Directors and that the Share Transfer Form has  been correctly completed. The Secretary will then advise the buyer that  share purchase funds may be transferred to the seller.</p><p data-block-key=\"d9u5m\">If the  Board of Directors decline to approve the buyer (no reasons need be  given); or the Share Transfer Form is not correctly completed, the  Secretary will advise buyer and sellers and suggest the action which  needs to be taken.</p><p data-block-key=\"6p3k2\">Following share sale approval in writing by the  Secretary, the seller must advise the company Secretary in writing when  the share purchase funds have been received. Once financial settlement  has occurred the Secretary will change ownership registration of the  share in the Company's share register and notify ASIC.</p><p data-block-key=\"f61n0\">The  Secretary will advise the buyer in writing of completion of share  transfer and registration; provide a door security key and other  introductory information.</p><p data-block-key=\"dn2j6\">The company booking IT system manager  and treasurer will set up an account on the company’s web-based booking  system in the buyer’s name and email address and advise the buyer. The  buyer can then book accommodation and commence use of the lodge.</p>",

failed EXIT lights; low firewood stock; something broken; or other) please make a note and advise the Secretary for follow up (refer CONTACT US page).  Occasionally the Directors organise a working bee to carry out maintenance and if interested in helping please advise your details to the Secretary.</p><p data-block-key=\"5md11\"><b>Garden Watering</b></p><p data-block-key=\"ft068\">The lodge employs a person to mow the lawns but not to do gardening and watering.  Mowing  activity is managed by the Ailsa Dee.  Shareholders and guests are  requested to help out by watering young shrubs/trees/bushes (front and back) during  periods of warm weather.  Long hoses are fitted front and back for this purpose (located near the car port and back  door).</p><p data-block-key=\"ammic\"><b>Smoke Detectors</b></p><p data-block-key=\"1g00\">The lodge is fitted each end with smoke detectors in corridors.  On occasion, one may “false trip” due to excessive bathroom steam escaping into the corridors, especially in winter when doors and windows are mostly closed.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are smoke detectors to be tampered with or disabled by removing batteries to silence them - this is very important for safety.  If needed, spare batteries are located in the pantry for replacement of a failed battery.</p><p data-block-key=\"1a55o\"><b>Keys</b></p><p data-block-key=\"7lvgj\">For security, the lodge has a special security key which cannot be duplicated without company permission.  Each Shareholding is issued with one key.  Please keep this key secure for the protection of the lodge.  A significant cost is incurred for the replacement of a lost key.  The key replacement cost will be billed to the shareholder.</p><p data-block-key=\"eu8ml\"><b>Security</b></p><p data-block-key=\"7nscv\">The lodge has 3 security cameras at various external locations.  These are movement sensitive and linked back to one of the Directors to monitor if necessary.  They are there to ensure the lodge remains secure during times of no occupancy, particularly with respect to pilfering of firewood and vandalism.  They are not used to monitor the activity of members legitimately using the lodge.</p>",

This material must not be allowed to accumulate in the kitchen or elsewhere inside the Premises.  Adequate RED garbage bins and YELLOW recycling bins are available.  Depending on volume, trips to the garbage tip should be regularly made, and responsible disposal of recyclable material is encouraged.  It will be the responsibility of all residents to share in the task of taking garbage to the tip.

No residents are permitted to be on the Premises at these times to ensure the cleaner has unhindered access.</p><p data-block-key=\"15ghk\">The Directors will publish a duties list which outlines duties to be performed by the residents of each room during and at the conclusion of their period of residency. The duties list is posted on the back of each bedroom door. It is a condition of occupancy that all residents perform their fair share of assigned duties for the harmonious operation and cleanliness of the Premises.  Where duties are assigned for a room and that room is not occupied for that week then the residents of rooms 2 and 3 shall perform those assigned duties as necessary in exchange for the benefits that are attributed to those two rooms by popularity.</p><p data-block-key=\"7ppbg\">If a resident leaves early they will still be required to clean the room they used and a reasonable amount of common area under the roster or otherwise.</p><p data-block-key=\"1khhg\">Departing residents are to take all perishable food with them and not leave any such items in the refrigerators or freezers.  Non-perishable food may be left for others on the shelves allocated for this purpose and not in the refrigerators or freezers.</p><p data-block-key=\"j2mm\">During their stay residents are to leave the toilets and showers in a reasonably clean state after each use and not to leave in them any items of clothing, soap or toiletries for the duration of the occupancy.</p><p data-block-key=\"8gape\">Breaches of these Rules</p><p data-block-key=\"2gda2\">In the application of penalties or other action relating to breaches of these Rules, the Senior Member for whom the booking was made will be entirely responsible for the actions or omissions of any resident or residents who occupied the Premises under that booking, whether the Senior Member was in attendance or not.  It will be the entire responsibility of the Senior Member to therefore inform their guests of the Rules and their obligation to occupy the Premises in accordance with these Rules.</p><p data-block-key=\"32sss\">The Management Committee will, at its discretion, decide the severity of individual or accumulated breaches of these Rules.</p><p data-block-key=\"497p8\">For any loss breakage or damage to property caused by residents, the Senior Member will be required to remedy the situation to the satisfaction of the Management Committee.

The Website can be<br/>accessed by only one username and password per share as advised by the Senior Member. The<br/>Website will be programmed to accept bookings in accordance with these rules, in particular with<br/>respect to seasonal occupancy rights and rental rates. The booking will be confirmed after payment<br/>has been made via the Website and after a Booking Acknowledgement form has been issued to the<br/>Senior Member by email. It will be the responsibility of the Senior Member to on pass this form to<br/>others where necessary.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"50dcg\">Booking Benefits and Restrictions</h3><p data-block-key=\"eo80j\">Members are able to use the lodge throughout the year, Different tariffs and room booking<br/>limitations apply during popular periods to ensure all members have an opportunity to use the<br/>lodge. During all bookings, a person meeting the “member in attendance” qualification must be<br/>present.</p><p data-block-key=\"74pi5\">Winter is defined as the months of July, August and September.  All other months are defined as<br/>summer. Winter rates are changed in December each year and Summer rates are changed in April<br/>each year.</p><p data-block-key=\"etnp6\">Bookings are normally made for one week, A Sunday-to-Sunday booking starts from the date of the<br/>first Sunday of occupancy, eg. a booking from the last Sunday in June which then runs into July<br/>would be deemed a summer booking. This will only apply during the first part week of winter.</p><p data-block-key=\"am73k\">In winter (excluding August), a member can book no more than 3 room-weeks in the same week. It<br/>will be best to book 2 rooms through website and 3rd through booking officer (our website is not<br/>currently capable of handling a 3 room booking).</p><p data-block-key=\"4spc\">In winter (August only), a member can book no more than 2 room-weeks in the entire month.  The 2<br/>room-weeks can be booked either concurrently or separately.</p><p data-block-key=\"4fqon\">In Winter, rooms 1,8 and 9 are available for full week or part week (including weekends) bookings.<br/>All other rooms are only available for full week bookings.</p><p data-block-key=\"cdaf8\">In Summer, members can book any number of rooms up to and including a “whole of lodge”<br/>booking. Our web site doesn’t currently cater for this whole lodge booking and requires a manual<br/>entry and invoice. Please contact our booking officer to book complete a whole of lodge booking for<br/>a summer week.</p><p data-block-key=\"4qbt2\">A member can make bookings no more than 26 weeks in advance of the first day of intended<br/>occupancy. </p><h3 data-block-key=\"6pj41\">Last Minute bookings</h3><p data-block-key=\"a3vif\">The Directors have decided to introduce a “last minute” booking option, which will only apply 2<br/>weeks before the required date for the available room. </p><p data-block-key=\"2em75\">Applicable only in winter (July to September inclusive), this will allow a Senior Member to make a<br/>booking for any available room without the normal limitations on number of room-weeks booked in<br/>each month.  </p><p data-block-key=\"3kvj\">The limitations on weekend bookings in only rooms 1,8 and 9 will still apply.</p><p data-block-key=\"4q4lv\">Making this last-minute booking will require the Senior Member to contact the Booking Officer (Noel<br/>Oxley) to make the booking and arrange payment.</p><p data-block-key=\"ftp3c\">For example, if a Senior Member already has 3 room-weeks booked in September, they would<br/>normally not be allowed to book any more room-weeks concurrently in that month.  If, however,<br/>there is a room still available 2 weeks out from when they wish to attend, they can apply to book<br/>that room by contacting Noel.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"osbm\">Cancellation of Booking</h3><p data-block-key=\"ahhf8\">Should a Senior Member need to cancel a booking a full refund of rents paid will be made if a<br/>written request is received 4 weeks prior to the first day of occupancy. If a request is received<br/>between 2 &amp;amp; 4 weeks prior to the day of occupancy a refund of 20% will be made. If less than 2<br/>weeks no refund will be made. At the discretion of the Booking Officer, refunds will only be paid to<br/>the Senior Member and this will be by transfer to a bank account, the details of which will be<br/>provided by the Senior Member. The amount refunded may be net of any fees or charges imposed<br/>by 3rd parties.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"5mvne\">Booking Conflicts</h3><p data-block-key=\"179li\">In instances where, through mis-programming or inadequacy of the Website, a booking is made<br/>which is at odds with these Rules the Booking Officer may, at his discretion and in consultation with<br/>the Senior Member, reject or amend the booking such that the conditions of these Rules will apply.</p>",

Shareholders are jointly responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the common areas and their individual bedrooms during their stay.</p><p data-block-key=\"io3e\">During winter and other heavily booked times a contract cleaner is engaged on Sundays to clean the entire lodge. The rates that are charged for residential occupancy recognise this operating model</p><p data-block-key=\"8mvmi\">The lodge provides beds &amp; mattresses, bathrooms and a fully equipped kitchen.  Guests provide their own bedding, toiletries and food.  There are rules pinned to the back of each bedroom door covering the requirement for guests to keep the lodge in a clean and tidy state during occupancy.  These rules also require residents to remove all personal belongings before checking out.  Importantly, on check-out, bathrooms, toilets, the kitchen and bedrooms used, must be in a clean and tidy state with all garbage disposed of.</p><p data-block-key=\"32lcu\">The management committee will periodically arrange more thorough cleaning by contractors.  Contract cleaning is relatively expensive and is provided for in the lodge operating model under the following conditions:</p><ol><li data-block-key=\"7ctvg\">   On Sundays (change-over day) in the months of June, July, August and September when very high occupancy of the lodge occurs;</li><li data-block-key=\"b1mnj\">   After occupancy by a single booker of the entire lodge at any time of the year;</li><li data-block-key=\"5bejt\">   On occasions when the management committee believes that occupancy has been at a sufficiently high level as to warrant thorough cleaning, and a financial justification for this applies.</li></ol><p data-block-key=\"dhm1g\">The use of contract cleaners outside the winter season will be the exception - not the rule.  It does not relieve the guests of the need to be responsible for their own cleaning.  It’s important that guests understand that, at all times, the self-catering nature of lodge operations requires them to clean the areas they used before checking out.  Even when contract cleaners are used, guests are not relieved of cleaning duties.</p><p data-block-key=\"benei\">Should residents be unable or unwilling to clean in situations outside those in 1 to 3 above, contract cleaning will be arranged by the management committee and the cost will be passed on to the resident.</p><p data-block-key=\"89mfl\">Should residents check out without cleaning in situations outside those in 1 to 3 above, action as covered for breeches of the Rules of Use of Company Property will apply.</p>",

      "body": "<p data-block-key=\"ugwio\">Statement of Policy</p><h4 data-block-key=\"a6jcu\">Subject: ADVICE FOR TRANSFERRING A SHARE IN NEIGE</h4><p data-block-key=\"5t4p1\">Neige Investments Pty Ltd is a NSW registered private (unlisted) company limited to 50 shares in its Constitution. Share transfers must only be transacted using the company’s share transfer form available on request from the Secretary. The company Secretary can assist buyers and sellers to make contact, and can provide guidance on completing the formal transfer documents.</p><p data-block-key=\"ap17r\">A share transfer will only be registered by the company if the buyer is a person. Shares cannot be registered by a trust, company, superannuation fund, or the name of an estate or deceased person. Prerequisites for share registration approval include, but are not limited to; receipt of a Share Transfer Form compliant with completion instructions; and approval of the buyer by the company’s Board of Directors as required by clause 11 of Neige Constitution.</p><p data-block-key=\"cqmhj\">A share transfer will require the buyer(s) to nominate one person to be considered the “Senior Member” and this person will be the only person registered on the Neige books as being the listed Senior Member.</p><p data-block-key=\"76ehu\">A share transfer is a private arrangement between the seller and buyer. As a service to sellers and prospective buyers, the Secretary maintains a list of people who have advised the company they are interested in purchasing a share.</p><p data-block-key=\"91cvd\">It is up to the buyer and seller to negotiate the share sale price. This does not involve the company, however, as a guide to the market price, the Secretary will on request, provide the seller and buyer the average price of the last three share sales and the most recent insurance valuation of the property.</p><p data-block-key=\"a8fi5\">The Company Constitution and Policies for use of company property are available on the Neige website. Sellers may provide these policies to prospective buyers to inform them of their privileges and obligations as a Neige shareholder.</p><p data-block-key=\"b4r1c\">It is strongly suggested the buyer seek written confirmation from the company Secretary as to the exact registered ownership details of the share number for sale and to confirm there are no outstanding moneys due to the Company relating to that Share.</p><p data-block-key=\"117oc\">The seller will confirm to the secretary if they are still in possession of a security door key. If not a fee of $170 for key replacement will be added to the sellers account, and the buyer notified of this debt. Each share is entitled to one door key only.</p><p data-block-key=\"ddvbs\">Once a price has been agreed between the seller and buyer, the seller should contact the Secretary to obtain a Share Transfer Form. The seller should then complete and sign their section of the form (notes are attached to the form to assist). All company registered owners of that share must sign the seller’s section of the form. [If the share is a deceased estate, contact the Secretary]. The seller then sends the form to the buyer with a copy to the Secretary who can assist with identifying any completion errors. The seller must also return their security key via registered post in a padded bag at their own expense to the Secretary at this time.</p><p data-block-key=\"evkvr\">No funds for the share purchase should be transferred by the buyer until the Secretary provides written approval that the share transfer has been approved by the company Board of Directors and the Share Transfer Form has been correctly executed [refer above note] by both seller and buyer.</p><p data-block-key=\"dsc6e\">The buyer (“Senior Member”) should then complete their section of the Share Transfer Form; ensuring only one buyer name and signature are used on the form. The form is then returned via Registered mail, to the Secretary.</p><p data-block-key=\"bht0p\">The Secretary will write to the buyer and provide, if appropriate, written approval that the share transfer has been approved by the company Board of Directors and that the Share Transfer Form has been correctly completed. The Secretary will then advise the buyer that share purchase funds may be transferred to the seller.</p><p data-block-key=\"d9u5m\">If the Board of Directors decline to approve the buyer (no reasons need be given); or the Share Transfer Form is not correctly completed, the Secretary will advise buyer and sellers and suggest the action which needs to be taken.</p><p data-block-key=\"6p3k2\">Following share sale approval in writing by the Secretary, the seller must advise the company Secretary in writing when the share purchase funds have been received. Once financial settlement has occurred the Secretary will change ownership registration of the share in the Company's share register and notify ASIC.</p><p data-block-key=\"f61n0\">The Secretary will advise the buyer in writing of completion of share transfer and registration; provide a door security key and other introductory information.</p><p data-block-key=\"dn2j6\">The company booking IT system manager and treasurer will set up an account on the company’s web-based booking system in the buyer’s name and email address and advise the buyer. The buyer can then book accommodation and commence use of the lodge.</p>",
